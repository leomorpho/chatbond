## Project Overview

Introducing "ConvoConnect" - A Revolutionary App to Rekindle Relationships and Spark Meaningful Conversations

In today's fast-paced world, it's easy to feel disconnected from our loved ones. We often find ourselves lost in superficial interactions that lack depth and genuine connection. That's where ConvoConnect comes in - an innovative app designed to help you reconnect and nurture relationships through meaningful conversations.

ConvoConnect is a unique platform that brings people together in conversation threads, creating an engaging and immersive experience. Our smart algorithm suggests thought-provoking questions that encourage self-reflection, promote empathy, and deepen understanding between participants. You can also choose your own questions to spark discussions tailored to your interests and relationships.

Here's how ConvoConnect works:

Create a conversation thread and invite your friends, family, or loved ones to participate.
Each person is presented with a question, either chosen by them or suggested by our intelligent algorithm.
Participants take their time to answer the question thoughtfully and honestly, sharing their insights and experiences.
Once everyone has answered, the responses are unveiled to all, fostering meaningful discussions and providing a safe space for vulnerability and growth.
With ConvoConnect, you'll find yourself engaged in purposeful conversations that strengthen bonds and enrich your relationships. Our app is designed to bridge the gap between loved ones, no matter the physical distance, by offering a platform to share thoughts, feelings, and life experiences in a nurturing and supportive environment.

Don't let the fast-paced digital world pull you further apart from those who matter most. Let ConvoConnect help you rediscover the beauty of genuine connection and meaningful conversation. Download ConvoConnect now and start nurturing your relationships today!

## Getting Started 🚀

This project contains 3 flavors:

- development
- staging
- production

More info on flavors [in this blog post](https://medium.com/@animeshjain/build-flavors-in-flutter-android-and-ios-with-different-firebase-projects-per-flavor-27c5c5dac10b).

To run the desired flavor either use the launch configuration in VSCode/Android Studio or use the following commands:

```sh
# Development
$ flutter run --flavor development --target lib/main_development.dart

# Staging
$ flutter run --flavor staging --target lib/main_staging.dart

# Production
$ flutter run --flavor production --target lib/main_production.dart
```

_\*ChatBond works on iOS, Android, Web, and Windows._

### Very Good Analysis

Run `flutter analyze` to enforce best practices.

---

## Running Tests 🧪

To run all unit and widget tests use the following command:

```sh
$ flutter test --coverage --test-randomize-ordering-seed random
```

To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).

```sh
# Generate Coverage Report
$ genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/

# Open Coverage Report
$ open coverage/index.html
```

## Working with Translations 🌐

This project relies on [flutter_localizations][flutter_localizations_link] and follows the [official internationalization guide for Flutter][internationalization_link].

### Adding Strings

1. To add a new localizable string, open the `app_en.arb` file at `lib/l10n/arb/app_en.arb`.

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    }
}
```

2. Then add a new key/value and description

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    },
    "helloWorld": "Hello World",
    "@helloWorld": {
        "description": "Hello World Text"
    }
}
```

3. Use the new string

```dart
import 'package:chatbond/l10n/l10n.dart';

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  final l10n = context.l10n;
  return Text(l10n.helloWorld);
}
```

### Adding Supported Locales

Update the `CFBundleLocalizations` array in the `Info.plist` at `ios/Runner/Info.plist` to include the new locale.

```xml
    ...

    <key>CFBundleLocalizations</key>
	<array>
		<string>en</string>
		<string>es</string>
	</array>

    ...
```

### Adding Translations

1. For each supported locale, add a new ARB file in `lib/l10n/arb`.

```
├── l10n
│   ├── arb
│   │   ├── app_en.arb
│   │   └── app_es.arb
```

2. Add the translated strings to each `.arb` file:

`app_en.arb`

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    }
}
```

`app_es.arb`

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "es",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Contador",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Texto mostrado en la AppBar de la página del contador"
    }
}
```

## Testing
### Answer Questions
* A user is able to answer a question for any number of friends. An already answered question for a friend can only be answered once.

## TODO:
* When a new question is answered, emit an event to add a new question thread in the proper question thread. This is important if the relevant question thread is in view. If no event is emitted, which should refresh that question threads' data, then the newly answered question WILL NOT show up as a question thread, until that page is reloaded by navigating away and back to it. The event could be QuestionAnsweredEvent and have the chatThread.id, so that if the chat thread is currently in view, it triggers a new GET from the BE.
